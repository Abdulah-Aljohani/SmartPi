  "body": "SmartPi - Turn your Raspberry Pi into a smart meter\r\n\r\nThe Smart Pi expansion module extends the Raspberry Pi with interfaces to measure voltage and current in a contactless manner. It enables to control electricity production consumption and turns the Raspberry Pi into a full featured smart meter. All measurement data can be stored and are accessable via the local network or Internet for disposal.\r\nCurrent is measured contactless via inductive current sensors. In the standard version currents up to 100 A can be measured. By exchanging the series resistor to use other sensors measure currents up to 300A is feasible.\r\nThe module has 4x 3.5mm jack inputs. Measurement of all three phases and even the neutral conductor is possible.\r\nTo get other dimensional units in addition to the current measurement, the SmartPi module has screw terminals to measure voltage in range of 400V on all phases.\r\nHereby e.g. the direction of energy flow is determinable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther units:\r\n\r\n* Current\r\n* Voltage\r\n* Power\r\n* Active power\r\n* Reactive power\r\n* Apparent power\r\n* Energy consumption\r\n* Energy generation\r\n* Power consumption\r\n* Power generation\r\n* Power frequency\r\n* Cos phi\r\n \r\n\r\nThe interfaces to the Raspberry Pi are electrically isolated to ensure maximum safety.\r\n\r\nInformations for installation: [http://blog.enerserve.eu/category/smartpi/installation-smartpi/](http://blog.enerserve.eu/category/smartpi/installation-smartpi/)\r\n\r\nUse: [http://blog.enerserve.eu/category/smartpi/use/](http://blog.enerserve.eu/category/smartpi/use/)\r\nAPI: [http://blog.enerserve.eu/category/smartpi/api/](http://blog.enerserve.eu/category/smartpi/api/)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou can buy it at: [https://shop.enerserve.eu/energiemanagement/zubehoer/262/smartpi](https://shop.enerserve.eu/energiemanagement/zubehoer/262/smartpi)",
